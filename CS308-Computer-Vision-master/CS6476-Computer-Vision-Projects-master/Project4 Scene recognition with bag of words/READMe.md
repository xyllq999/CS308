# CS 6476 project 4: [Scene Recognition with Bag-of-Words](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision/proj4/)

# Setup
- Install Anaconda / Miniconda
- Create a conda environment using the given file: `conda env create -f environment_<OS>.yml`
- This should create an environment named `cs6476p4`. Activate it using `activate cs6476p4`


I didn't succeed in implementing any extra credit code. Simply run the code in starter code and you will check the results of Tiny images and Nearest Neighbor, Bag of SIFT and Nearest Neighbor and Bag of SIFT and Linear SVM classifier.
